### Building Python files from Qt Designer
If you are using Qt Designer to create UIs and resource files, you'll need to convert them to Python files before they can be used in the program. 

To convert .ui files to Python:
```bash
pyuic5 <ui file> -o <output.py>
```

To convert .qrc resource files to Python:
```bash
pyrcc5 <qrc file> -o <output.py>
```

### Create an executable with PyInstaller
To make releases you need to create an executable. PyInstaller provides an easy way to create one.
```bash
python -m PyInstaller <file.py>
```
However, it's a good idea to use a .spec file to properly access assets in the completed installer.

This [tutorial](https://blog.aaronhktan.com/posts/2018/05/14/pyqt5-pyinstaller-executable) has a great explanation of how to properly create the installer.

### Create a Debian package
To make a release with the executable generated by PyInstaller, run this command after reading the tutorial above for how to setup your directory.
```bash
dpkg-deb --build raspicontrolpanel-x.x.x
```
